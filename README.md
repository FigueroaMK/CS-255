# CS-255

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
   For this project the client was DriverPass a company that aims to provide their customers with an online services for driving classes, including up-to-date DMV information, practice tests and in-person driving lessons with an administrative multi-level access.

What did you do particularly well?
    I believe the UML diagrams ended up being my stronger suit, since it was the most interesting part of the content.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    I woupd problably revise the Requirements documents. The begining of this course was very unclear for me, the assigned book for this course providing very little help in understanding the concepts discusse. However, between the provided feedback and progressing through the course I believe I could do a better job on those.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
   It is important to consider the user needs because the client's focus may not fully encompase those needs. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
   From the content of this class specifically, I had never seen UML sequence or the UML Activity Diagrams and I hope this are tools I get to apply in future.
